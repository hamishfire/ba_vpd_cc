Code related to an analysis of burned area, vapour pressure deficit and climate change

The key code runs a generalised linear model for combinations of WWF Terrestrial Biomes 
with sub-continental windows of MODIS burned area data

The model predicts the probability of fire as a function of vapour pressure deficit,
as calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis
